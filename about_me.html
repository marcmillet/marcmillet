				<h1>About me</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Legend states that a kid was born in Santiago de Compostela in 1995. He wouldn’t stop quiet for a moment, except when food was involved:
					he loved eating and was aaalways hungry (he was well fed, must be said). Due to the mix of languages he was tought into: catalan with the
					mother, german with the father, spanish and galician with friends and neighbours and in english in school, that poor kid, who’s name is Marc,
					had such a mental chaos that he didn’t start to speak properly until some years of age. What kind of parents teach a son in multiple languages
					and cultures? It must have been very funny to look at that kid mixing up three or four languages in a same sentence, although not so funny to
					live... (no traumas there).
				</p>
				<p>
					After those first years, everything became normal until his parents decided to take him one year to Berlin. Can you believe it? Taking a
					six years old to Berlin, where he lived an unforgettable year and where he made forever lasting friends... poor kid again! And that wasn’t the
					only time something like that happened to him, as he was taken to germany again at age 14. Who takes a teenager out his comfort zone, who???
					Insane parents...
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, at age 18 he decided to flee and desapeared. It is rumored that he has been living in Barcelona ever since, studying Industrial
					Engineering at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.
				</p>
				<p>
					The people that knew him best remember him as a joyful, positive and hard working person, very organized and somebody who pursued his dreams
					until the end. He is open to any project or job you may want to offer him, wherever in the world you are.
